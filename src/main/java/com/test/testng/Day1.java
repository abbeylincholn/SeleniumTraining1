    /** TestNG is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but designed to be more powerful and flexible.
    * It's primarily used for automated testing in Java, especially in combination with Selenium for web application testing.
    * The "NG" stands for "Next Generation."
ðŸ”§ What does TestNG do? TestNG provides:
    A way to write and run automated unit, functional, and integration tests.
    Annotations to control test execution (@Test, @BeforeClass, @AfterMethod, etc.)
    Support for parallel testing, data-driven testing, and grouping of tests.
    Better reporting features compared to JUnit.
    Defining multiple test case methods in a single class.
    You can modularise the testcases based on functionalities and trigger them using testng.xml according to your requirement.
    You can also get a control on running specific methods from testng.xml.
    Easy integration with build tools like Maven, Gradle, and CI tools like Jenkins.
